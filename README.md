THE CODE EXPLAIN HOW REQUIRE, ASSERT AND REVERT FUNCTION WORKS


Require: It explain how the condition is met and how an error can be thrown
// This can accept two input in the parentheses i.e require( input 1, input 2)
// input one serves as the condition to be met while input is a message to be displayed if input 1 condition is not met 


Assert : A condition must be met for the code to proceed execution

Revert: If a condition is not met, it automatically ends the program and the remaining code can be reusable
