### Checklist Smart Contract

This smart contract serves as a checklist manager on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to manage tasks, including adding new tasks, marking tasks as complete, updating task content, and removing tasks.

### Features:

- Add Task: Users can add new tasks to the checklist.
- Mark Task Complete: Tasks can be marked as complete once they are finished.
- Update Task: Users can update the content of existing tasks.
- Remove Task: Tasks can be removed from the checklist.
- Get Task Details: Retrieve details of a specific task.
- Get Total Tasks: View the total number of tasks in the checklist.

### Error Handling:

- require(): Ensures conditions are met before executing functions, preventing invalid inputs or unexpected behavior.
- assert(): Validates internal conditions to ensure they remain true during execution, detecting critical errors.
- revert(): Halts execution and reverts any changes made, commonly used for handling unexpected conditions or invalid inputs.

### How to Use:
Deploy the Checklist contract on an Ethereum network (Mainnet, Ropsten, Rinkeby, etc.).
Interact with the deployed contract using a web3 provider like MetaMask or a platform like Remix.
Utilize functions such as addTask, markTaskComplete, updateTask, removeTask, getTaskDetails, and getTotalTasks to manage tasks in the checklist.

### Requirements:
Solidity ^0.8.0
Ethereum wallet and a web3 provider for interaction (e.g., MetaMask)
